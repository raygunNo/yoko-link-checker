# Yoko Link Checker - Quick Guide

> A simple guide for checking broken links on WordPress sites before launch.

---

## What Is It?

Yoko Link Checker scans your WordPress site for broken links and reports any issues. Run it before launching a site to catch dead links, missing pages, and redirect chains.

---

## Where to Find It

In WordPress Admin:
1. Go to **Link Checker** in the left sidebar
2. You'll see the **Dashboard** with scan controls and stats

---

## Running a Scan

### Starting a Scan

1. Go to **Link Checker → Dashboard**
2. Click **Start Scan**
3. Watch the progress bar — the scan runs in the background
4. When complete, you'll see a summary of results

### What Gets Scanned

- All published **Pages** and **Posts**
- Links in the content (both internal and external)
- Images and media files

### How Long Does It Take?

Depends on site size:
- Small site (50 pages): ~2-3 minutes
- Medium site (200 pages): ~10-15 minutes
- Large site (500+ pages): ~30-45 minutes

You can leave the page and come back — progress is saved.

## Fixing Broken Links

### Recommended Workflow

4. **Update the page**
5. **Move to the next broken link**

### Common Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Page was deleted | Remove the link or link to replacement content |
| URL typo | Correct the URL |
| Page moved | Update to new URL |
| External site gone | Remove the link or find alternative |

## Tips & Best Practices

### Before Site Launch

1. Run a full scan
2. Fix all **Broken** links (priority)
3. Review **Warnings** and **Redirects**
4. Re-scan to confirm fixes

### Ignoring Links

Some links may be intentionally blocked (member-only content, external sites that block bots). These are fine to ignore if you've verified them manually.

### When to Re-scan

- After fixing broken links
- After major content updates
- Before any site launch or migration
- Monthly for ongoing maintenance

## Common Questions

### Why is a working link showing as "Warning"?

Some external sites (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram) block automated checks. If you can visit the link in a browser, it's fine.

### Why is an internal page showing as "Broken"?

The page may be:
- In draft/pending status (not published)
- Password protected
- Deleted or trashed

### Can I scan only specific pages?

Currently scans all published content. Future versions may add selective scanning.

### Will scanning slow down the site?

No — the scanner is designed to work in small batches and won't impact site performance for visitors.
