# Yoko Link Checker

A performant, extensible broken link checker for WordPress. Scans content for links, checks their validity, and reports issues.

**Version:** 1.1.0 | **Requirements:** WordPress 6.0+ | PHP 8.0+

## Description

Yoko Link Checker helps you identify and fix broken links across your WordPress website. It scans your posts, pages, and custom post types for links, validates them, and provides detailed reports to help you maintain a healthy site.

**Designed for managed WordPress hosting** — uses WordPress-native functions for internal URL verification to avoid PHP worker exhaustion on thread-limited hosts like Kinsta, WP Engine, and Flywheel.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Scans posts, pages, and custom post types for links
- **Smart Internal URL Checking**: Verifies internal links using WordPress functions (no HTTP overhead)
- **HTTP Fallback**: Falls back to HTTP checks for custom routes and plugin pages
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large sites efficiently with AJAX-driven batch processing
- **Status Classification**: Categorizes link issues (broken, redirect, warning, timeout, blocked)
- **Admin Dashboard**: Clean interface with real-time progress and stats
- **Link Reports**: View all links with status filtering, search, and CSV export
- **Intelligent Classification**: Handles quirky sites (LinkedIn 999, Facebook 403, etc.)
- **Extensible Architecture**: Filters and hooks for customization

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 8.0 or higher

## Installation

### From GitHub

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Yoko-Co/yoko-link-checker/releases) page
2. Upload the `yoko-link-checker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yoko-Co/yoko-link-checker.git
   ```
2. Copy the folder to your WordPress plugins directory
3. Activate the plugin in WordPress admin

## Usage

1. Navigate to **Link Checker** in the WordPress admin sidebar
2. Click **Start Scan** to begin scanning your content
3. Watch real-time progress as links are discovered and checked
4. Go to **Link Checker → Reports** to view detailed results
5. Filter by status (Broken, Warning, Redirect, etc.)
6. Click source links to edit pages with broken links
7. Export results to CSV for sharing or tracking

## Link Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Valid** | Link works (200 response) |
| **Broken** | Link returns 404 or error |
| **Warning** | Needs manual review (blocked by site, unusual response) |
| **Redirect** | Link redirects to another URL |
| **Blocked** | Access denied (401/403) |
| **Timeout** | Request timed out |

## Configuration

The plugin provides several configuration options:

- **Post Types**: Select which post types to scan
- **Check Timeout**: Set timeout for HTTP requests
- **Batch Size**: Configure posts/URLs processed per batch

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'YOKO_LC_DEBUG', true );
```

Logs are written to `wp-content/debug.log`.

## Architecture

The plugin follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
src/
├── Admin/           # Admin UI (Dashboard, Reports, AJAX handlers)
├── Checker/         # Link validation (HTTP client, status classifier)
├── Extractor/       # Content extraction (HTML parsing, link discovery)
├── Model/           # Data models (Url, Link, Scan)
├── Repository/      # Data persistence (URL deduplication, queries)
├── Scanner/         # Scan orchestration (batch processing, state)
└── Util/            # Utilities (logging, URL normalization)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Internal URLs use WordPress functions** — `url_to_postid()`, taxonomy lookups, attachment checks — avoiding self-referential HTTP requests that can deadlock PHP workers.

2. **HTTP fallback for unverified internal URLs** — Custom routes and plugin pages that WordPress can't resolve are checked via HTTP with a short timeout.

3. **URL deduplication via SHA-256 hashing** — Same URL appearing on 100 pages = 1 HTTP check.

4. **AJAX-driven batch processing** — Each batch is a separate request, preventing timeout issues and enabling real-time progress.

## Development

```

## Filters & Hooks

```php
// Customize post types to scan
add_filter( 'yoko_lc_scannable_post_types', fn($types) => ['post', 'page', 'product'] );

// Skip specific URLs
add_filter( 'yoko_lc_skip_url_check', fn($skip, $url) => str_contains($url, 'localhost'), 10, 2 );

// Adjust batch sizes
add_filter( 'yoko_lc_discovery_batch_size', fn() => 100 );
add_filter( 'yoko_lc_checking_batch_size', fn() => 10 );

// Customize internal HTTP check
add_filter( 'yoko_lc_internal_http_args', fn($args, $url) => $args, 10, 2 );

// Hook into scan lifecycle
add_action( 'yoko_lc_scan_completed', fn($scan) => wp_mail(...) );
```
